### Project Structure
The project structure diagram provides a visual representation of the `go-test-be` application's architecture. It outlines the organization of the codebase, including the directory structure, the main components, and how they interact with each other. This diagram is especially useful for new developers or contributors to get acquainted with the project layout quickly.

#### Key Components

- **Routes:** Defined in the `routes` directory, this is where all the API endpoints are specified. Each route is linked to a specific controller method.
- **Controllers:** Controllers are responsible for handling requests and returning responses. They are located in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory.
- **Requests:** Requests are used to validate incoming requests. They are located in the `app/Http/Requests` directory.
- **Resources:** Resources are used to transform models into JSON responses. They are located in the `app/Http/Resources` directory.
- **Services:** Services are used to encapsulate business logic and are located in the `app/Services` directory.
- **Models:** Representing the application's data structure, models are found in the `app/Models` directory. They interact with the database and perform all data-related operations.
- **Database Migrations:** The `database/migrations` directory contains all the migration files that define the database schema. Migrations make it easy to modify the database structure.

- **Middleware:** Middleware are filters that get executed before and after your application handles a request. They are located in the `app/Http/Middleware` directory.

- **Tests:** All test cases are stored in the `tests` directory. This project follows TDD (Test-Driven Development), and every piece of code should have corresponding tests.
